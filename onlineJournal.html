  <p>I have a pretty busy schedule today. First, I had my class <b>Interactivity II</b> from 8:00am to 10:30am. We covered some basic topics like attribute tags. I also learned some more about how GitHub works.</p>

  <p>After class, I'm going to eat breakfast at the dining hall. I used a picture of a bagel for my website in class, so now I'm <i>really</i> hungry for a bagel...</p>

  <p>After breakfast, I need to do my readings for my next class and take notes. I'll get something to eat, and then I have my class <b>Italian Art of the High Renaissance and Maniera</b> from 3:30pm to 4:45pm.</p>

  <p>After class, I'll get something to eat at the dining hall, and then at 7:00pm I'll head to Fleming Gym for the <b>CVPA Basketball game takeover.</b> I'm attending the game as a CVPA peer guide. I'm told there will be snacks, so I want to make sure I have room for that.</p>

  <p>After all that, I'll just chill for the rest of the day. Luckily I don't have any classes on Friday, so aside from a few hours where I'll be in a meeting, I'll have the day free to just relax :)</p>
